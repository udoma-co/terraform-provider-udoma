## Schema

### Required

- `inputs` (Attributes) A custom form to collect data with (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--inputs))
- `name` (String) The name of the appointment template.

### Optional

- `confirmation_reminders` (List of Number) The number of days after which a reminder should
				be sent out. The list is taken as provided and a reminder will be set
				for the amount of days as set in the first element of the list. Once
				that time has passed, the reminder will be rescheduled for the next
				element in the list. This is repeated until the list is empty. The
				values in the list are considered relative to the previous reminder.
				So [2, 2] will send out a reminder after 2 and 4 days. The reminders
				will, however, not be sent out on weekends. So if the first reminder is
				sent out on a Friday, the second reminder will be sent out on Tuesday.
