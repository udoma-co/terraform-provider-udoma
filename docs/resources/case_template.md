### Nested Schema for `config`

Optional:

- `automatic_actions` (Attributes List) The configuration for automatic status changes of a case. This is 
			used to determine which status changes are allowed by which party at which time. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--automatic_actions))
- `reminders` (Attributes List) The configuration for sending out reminders for a case. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--reminders))
- `status_config` (Attributes List) The configuration for the status transition of a case. This is 
			used to determine which status changes are allowed by which party at which time. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--status_config))

<a id="nestedatt--config--automatic_actions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.automatic_actions`

Required:

- `action` (String) JS script of the action that should be executed, if the schedule and execution
        check are successful.
- `schedule` (Number) The number of days after which the status change should be triggered. The 
        schedule is reset, whenever the case is updated. 0 means that the action
        should be triggered immediately.
- `status` (String) The status in which the case has to be, for the automatic action to be triggered.


<a id="nestedatt--config--reminders"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.reminders`

Required:

- `schedule` (List of Number) The number of days after which a reminder should be sent out. The list is 
        taken as provided and a reminder will be set for the amount of days as set
        in the first element of the list. Once that time has passed, the reminder
        will be rescheduled for the next element in the list. This is repeated until
        the list is empty. The values in the list are considered relative to the
        previous reminder. So [2, 2] will send out a reminder after 2 and 4 days.
        The reminders will, however, not be sent out on weekends. So if the first
        reminder is sent out on a Friday, the second reminder will be sent out on
        Tuesday. All reminders are reset, whenever the case is updated.
- `status` (String) The status in which the case has to be, for the reminder to be sent out.
